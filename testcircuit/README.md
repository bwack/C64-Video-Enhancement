# Test device for the C64 video enhancement mod

In case of a series production of the mod, you probably need some means
to test the mod boards without actually installing them into a real C64.
For this purpose, the necessary input signals can be generated by a 
second FPGA board, programmed to simulate the various VIC signals.
These are fed into the VIC adapter board (via a ZIF socket for example)
which will in turn drive the FPGA board under test to generate the test image.

The provided firmware (TestSignalGenerator.pof) will turn a standard 
C64 video enhanchement board  into a signal generator that uses the GPIO1 port 
and two additional pins as outputs instead of inputs.
Be careful to use such a board only for this test purpose, as
it will cause damage to connect some other signal source to these outputs.
